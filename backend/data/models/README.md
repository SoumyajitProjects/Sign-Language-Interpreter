# ML Models Directory

This directory should contain the trained machine learning models for sign language detection.

## Expected Files:

1. `asl_model.h5` - TensorFlow/Keras model for ASL alphabet recognition
2. `hand_landmark_model.pkl` - Pickled model for hand landmark processing
3. `sign_classifier.pkl` - Scikit-learn classifier for sign classification

## Model Training:

The models should be trained on ASL alphabet datasets and saved in this directory.

## Current Status:

For development purposes, the system uses mock responses. Replace with actual trained models for production use.
